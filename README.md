# VolumetricMedical

## Project Information

This project is a collaborative effort between UBC Emerging Media Lab and UBC Faculty of Medicine's IT Department. The project is aimed at providing an interactive and fully-immersive learnging experience for undergraduate students in medicine. Through the use of volumetric video, realistic 3D models of anatomical objects, and a gamified differential diagnosis test, we hope to enhance education and help pedagogy transcend beyond physical boundaries.

Work on the project began in May 2019 and is expected to continue till September 2019.
